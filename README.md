## Introduction

DataKernel is a full-featured **alternative Java framework** for efficient and scalable web, network and big data solutions.
It is **event-driven** and **legacy-free**, featuring modern **high-level abstractions** and **DSLs**. Its **asynchronous** 
architecture was **inspired by Node.js**. 

DataKernel main goal is to **free Java projects** from the frameworks which restrict developers with redundant standards and 
boilerplates. Get a **true freedom** to express yourself as a developer - create projects and **concentrate on their 
business logic instead of learning framework specifications**. 

DataKernel consists of three modules:
 * [Core](https://datakernel.io/docs/core/) - building blocks of the framework and everything you need to create **asynchronous web applications**.
 * [Cloud](https://datakernel.io/docs/cloud/) - components for **decentralized cloud solutions** of different complexity.
 * [Global Cloud](https://datakernel.io/docs/global-cloud/) (coming soon) - components for **ultimately scalable**, decentralized, yet practical and high-performance **cloud solutions**.
